###  Recipe Finder - Saving Starving Minervans, one affordable recipe at a time.
This project contains the implementation of a culinary expert system that recommends recipes (from Spoonacular) to students. Fundamentally, it collects basic information like dietary preferences, budget, calorie limit, etc, to personalize recipes to different people. 

It also combats food waste by encourage a search by ingredients, prompting students to utilize left overs while exploring their palete.

##### Execution steps
In other to run this app, a virtual environment is necessary.

Follow these steps in terminals (windows)
```
python -m venv venv
```

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python app.py
```

Unfortunately, we both use windows, but the directions should be similar for mac.


#### Have fun!
