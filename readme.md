###  Recipe Finder - Saving Starving Minervans, one affordable recipe at a time.
This project contains the implementation of a culinary expert system that recommends recipes (from Spoonacular) to students. Fundamentally, it collects basic information like dietary preferences, budget, calorie limit, etc, to personalize recipes to different people. 

This is an expert system using Prolog to help you find recipes with your preferences.

Please, run the commands bellow to get it running!

python -m venv venv
```

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python app.py
```

Unfortunately, we both use windows, but the directions should be similar for mac.


#### Have fun!
